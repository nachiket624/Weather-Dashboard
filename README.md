# 🌦️ Power BI Weather Dashboard  

![Weather Dashboard Demo](output/Weather.gif)  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is a **Power BI interactive weather dashboard** built using a **Weather API**.  
It provides real-time weather updates, forecasts, air quality index (AQI), and other environmental parameters in a visually appealing way.  

The dashboard is designed for:  
- Tracking **current weather conditions** 🌡️  
- Analyzing **7-day forecast trends** 📊  
- Monitoring **air quality parameters** 🌍  
- Visualizing **sunrise & sunset times** 🌅  
- Understanding **rain probability** 🌧️

## ⚙️ Features  

✅ **Current Weather Data** – Temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, pressure, precipitation, and visibility.  
✅ **7-Day Forecast Chart** – Displays upcoming weather patterns.  
✅ **Air Quality Index (AQI)** – Includes PM10, PM2.5, O3, SO2, NO2, CO levels.  
✅ **Sunrise & Sunset Tracking** – Daily timing updates.  
✅ **Chance of Rain (%)** – Forecasted precipitation probabilities.  
✅ **Multiple City Comparisons** – View weather data for multiple locations (e.g., Dehali, Goa, Kopargaon).
